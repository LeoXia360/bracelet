Bracelet brings gesture control to your smart home. Bracelet is a wearable band with an array of sensors. Easily configure any smart IoT device in your household (provided we have the API for it), set a unique trigger action for the specific device, and voila -- you are ready to go. To use, simply activate the bracelet (double clench fist), and then choose from any of your trigger actions to control your IoT devices like magic.
